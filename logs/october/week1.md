# Week 1 (October 2025)

**Topics Covered:**  
Advanced SQL topics such as INNER, LEFT, RIGHT joins; subqueries; window functions; and aggregations.

**Breakthroughs:**  
Learned to write complex queries combining multiple tables. Used window functions for running totals and rankings.

**Challenges:**  
Window functions syntax was challenging at first—reviewed examples and documented key patterns.

**Next Steps:**  
Implement SQL queries in Python projects (e.g., sales forecasting).

**Reflection:**  
Advanced SQL skills will add great value to data projects requiring relational data handling.
