# Week 1 (September 2025)

**Topics Covered:**  
Introduction to NumPy, array creation, indexing, slicing, and basic operations. Learned how to perform mathematical operations efficiently on arrays.

**Breakthroughs:**  
Understood the power of vectorized operations which are faster than loops. Gained confidence using NumPy functions like `np.arange()`, `np.reshape()`, and broadcasting.

**Challenges:**  
Had initial trouble with array shapes and broadcasting rules. Practiced with small examples to clarify these concepts.

**Next Steps:**  
Explore multi-dimensional arrays and matrix operations.

**Reflection:**  
NumPy fundamentals are essential for any data analysis work. Feeling excited to use these tools in real datasets.
