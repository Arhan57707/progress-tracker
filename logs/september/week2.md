**Challenges:**  
Faced difficulty understanding different types of missing data. Researched examples online to better understand.

**Next Steps:**  
Practice more on real-world dirty datasets; start exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Reflection:**  
Cleaning data is time-consuming but crucial. Developed patience and attention to detail skills.
